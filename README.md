This is my Semester-6 End Project for the course "Reinforcement Learning".

This project focuses on Network traffic classification as malicious or benign using Reinforcement learning algorithm.
It also gives a clear comparison between the adaptability for Worm Detection between Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms, dynamic Deep Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning.

Conclusion - Adaptability of RL transcends all other algorithms.
